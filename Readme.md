https://devichs.github.io is a static website in a blog format.  

I've built the site using only html, css, and java script from the Twitter bootstrap template, modifying as needed. 

Before putting this together I fooled around with a static site generator called Pelican. Pelican uses Python and Jinja2 templates

to put a site together through Themes.  The Pelican Themes are in github.  The site is generated by using a configuration file.  

This process can be seen in the Pelican docs and github. 

--General rules used to navigate through the addition of articles and categories. 

index.html [points to ..category/misc.html in the post discription and navigation menu under categories. 
This will have an article count per category]
 -categories.html [side bar menu item points to ..category/misc.html]
 -category [folder holding the named category html page(s)]
  -misc.html [each category gets an html page with a link to the categorized article]

The site was put together with Visual Studio by creating an empty ASP.NET page and stripping all unecessary components.

It was a pain getting the layout of the blog together and will be more of a pain as articles/categories are added but it 

was a good exercise that gave me a better understanding of how the Pelican/Jinja2 process works.
